# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guided is designed to help students prepare for the bootcamp by teaching them the basics of how to think like a develop along with familiarizing them with the developer tools of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript at a basic level. 

In addition, I learned to troubleshoot in the process of completing the study guide. I used video guides, forums, and chatGPT to help find solutions when I encountered a problem.
